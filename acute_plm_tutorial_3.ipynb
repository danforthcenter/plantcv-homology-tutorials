    "# Exercise 3: Generating homology groups from pseudo-landmark data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this third exercise we will review one of the downstream applications of our batch plm data we generated in our previous exercise by generating de novo homology groups.  It should be noted that this method, while incredibly powerful, has some prior assumptions in its usage.  To drive home the point, THIS METHOD IS DESIGNED TO ESTIMATE GROUPS BY MAKING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT BIOLOGICAL HOMOLOGY (i.e. not persistent homology which is an completely different analytical method!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, when image data of sufficient quality is presented to this workflow homology groups could even be inferred to be orthologous to one another although, similar to (phylo)genetic clustering methods, you get out what you put in and so this may be subjective based on your dataset.  That being said, there are concievably two datasets where this homology grouping set is applicable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Linking landmarks through time series image data to survey growth and development of independent structures through time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Linking landmarks between comparable static materials either between individuals or genotypes for comparing variability of these landmarks in analogous organismal datasets (i.e. leaves with readily apparent lobes, awns, or sinuses, as one example).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given our homology grouping workflow was designed for the former dataset we will work through a demonstration of how this works and how best to go about performing this analysis in an idealized dataset.  Let's get started by importing what we need...\n"

    "Thus far, we've largely been considering this data as a table where we really only cared about our X-Y coordinates that describe our plms. However, when we think about this matrix beyond the the filename and plm x/y columns we can see that we really have quite a few extra dimensions which add some context to our data.  These added dimensions were originally deemed to be potentially useful for generating a rich multivariate dataset to to pull these plms together into homology groups.  `space` no longer is seen as a required component of this pipeline, however, given that analyses seem to only produce negligibly better results with it's inclusion.  That being said, this approach does produce some novel types of metadata which could have alternative applications so we'll at least discuss what `space` is doing here in it's original context, even if we gloss over it in tutorial 4. You may have also noticed we now have a new empty column we've added that didn't exist before called 'group' but for now we'll just ignore it. \n",

    "\n",
    "To begin we can consider five distance elements, 'bot_left_dist', 'bot_right_dist', 'top_left_dist', 'top_right_dist', and 'centroid_dist'.  These new values are distances between the plms representing each row and the bounding box corners capturing our current image pairs plms. In addition, we also calculate a centroid point for our current image pair to generate a distance from the 'center of gravity' for these paired plms.  Given we've largely focused on spatial positions alone distance measures, while analogous in terms of being pixel measures, help by giving us some added indication as to where in space our landmarks fall compared to one another.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond these distance measures we have two other elements, 'orientation' and 'centroid_orientation'.  As could be anticipated from these names these elements are both providing some additional information about the direction of the plms in space as opposed to raw distance measures, however, they are accomplishing this in very different ways.  The 'orientation' measures are based purely on the plm, SS, TS coordinates in which the midpoint between SS and TS are calculated and this midpoint is then used to drive a line towards the plm to generate a slope. Following the generation of a slope an angle can be generated using the formula:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    angle = arctan(slope)*(180/pi)\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, the 'centroid_orientation' begins at the centroid and drives a line towards the plm to generate a slope then uses a similar formula to what was described above in order to calculate an angle of orientation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a multivariate dataset that is rich in context for comparisons to be made we can begin to determine how similar or distant they are to one another through time. For the initial steps we will use two approaches, PCA which is extremely useful in maximizing the amount of variation while reducing dimensionality (key in a dataset such as ours) followed by clustering approaches used to link nearest neighbors (which will help us stitch our plms together through time).\n",

    "Although we initially only see the hierarchical cluster used by Constella shown as a dendrogram graphic quite a bit has actually happened when we ran this function in order to generate our homology groupings!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by thinking about what our hierarchical cluster of our neighboring frames looks like in this graphic.  We can see that for the vast majority of our plms there appear to be paired points which correspond to a plm from each frame (given the 3D plot from our starscape plot this probably isn't much of a surprise!).  Given this initial finding it would almost seem at first glance that focusing on groups consisting of two plms would be sufficient, however, there is some nuance to plm datasets given they are dynamically describing growth as it occurs.  For example, we can see at least one case in which clusters of three plms form within this dendrogram, and another more complex situation in which day 11 plm 2 becomes a rogue point in the proximity of a pair of homology groups.  In each of these cases one of the emergent plms that just appeared in the day 11 frame is clustering around its nearest cluster pair in the starscape output.  Even when they are no longer emergent it is often common for these new points to rapidly migrate for several days before reaching stationarity as the structure they represent grows and eventually arrests its development.  As such we need a fairly robust means of describing structures which are more or less non-moving while also being able to dynamically characterize noisier subcomponents of the dataset which may be undertaking fairly rapid change for a transient period of time.  Ultimately Constella is designed around the concept for describing groups as duets which are adjacent to one another in time.  Let's use a series of examples to grasp this concept:\n",

    "In the manner described above, Constella operates through iteratively assigning points identities through an expanding nearest neighbor homology grouping scheme which is superfically similar to neighbor joining.

    "## Constella groups: seeding vs. linking\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have covered the basics of how Constella detects groups it is worth taking a moment to discuss how Constella assigns names.  There are generally two strategies which largely are based on if prior encounters with plms that are being grouped through image series/time series data has occurred.  When we first began this notebook we assigned the variable 'group_iter' to 1 which serves as our counter variable for assigning serial numbers to each homology group as Constella detects them.  When a novel group is detected, be it a duet, graded pair in a quartet, or rogue plms Constella 'seeds' these groups by assigning them the current group_iter number and iterating the counter by one.  By contrast, some groups should be expected to appear for several images in a row, especially in time series data, and in these cases an identity is already established for one of the current pair.  In these cases 'linking' occurs in which the known identity for one of the pair is passed on to the yet to be defined member so that the identity of this group is allowed to be carried through time or across an image series of analogous data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given this naming strategy of assigning numbers as identities it is probably worth noting that although Constella is designed for use in homology-based approaches it operates in an analogous sphere to de novo genome assemblers in that although both can identify probable relationships (either as genomic scaffolds or plm linkage groups) it makes no attempt to assign known identity to these groups akin to changing scaffold identities to that of known chromosomes for a given genome.  This step of defining plm groups as a specific leaf tip, a leaf axil/ligule, or a floral structure such as an inflorescence apex is a post analysis step to be undertaken by an end user.\n",
